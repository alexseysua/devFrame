## Terms Of Service
The devFrame is distributed under the [CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2](https://github.com/goodrobots/devFrame/blob/master/License.md).  These documents are also covered under said license.  That's a big reason we use the CERN OHL.

## Privacy Statement
The devFrame docs are hosted as a static site on GitHub Pages.  We do not run any analytics or tracking scripts on this site.  We do not ask for any information.    

**However, since we do not control the servers that run the site you should have a look at GitHub's own [Terms](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) and [Privacy](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) pages.**
