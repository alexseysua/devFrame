## Background
Goodrobots is a very small team of volunteers who like to build robot hardware and software under permissive open source licenses.  We do it for fun and to learn new things.  We can always use [help making things better]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/).

The devFrame project is intended to help democratize small robotic research and development by reducing barriers to entry.  We will achieve this by providing:

- A simple Open Source frame design that leverages 3D printing and off the shelf parts
- Detailed information about the devFrame build process for common use cases
- Detailed information about the software configuration for common devFrame setups 

## Comments And Questions
Since we are a small team of volunteers we like to hang out on Gitter to answer any questions.  The devFrame has it's own channel: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/goodrobots/devframe.svg)](https://gitter.im/goodrobots/devframe?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
