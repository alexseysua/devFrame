### Spend less time building and maintaining so you can spend more time developing and flying.
The devFrame is a 3D printable, Open Source quadcopter and rover frame design.  Supports 300-500 class quadcopter frames in Stretch X, Hybrid X and H configurations, as well as skid steer rovers (rover coming soon).

To complete your build we provide step by step instructions to take you from a pile of parts on the bench to a flying, or roving, robot.  Complete with video, pictures and links to resources.
