## Who This Is For

Short answer:  Adventurous builders who need or want the flexibility of building robots from open source ecosystems, and are willing to learn.  Long answer...

While we try to provide enough information to help you achieve your devFrame building goals we do make some assumptions about skill and motivation levels.  Building a robot from a kit is time consuming.  The biggest goal for the devFrame project is to reduce the amount of time and effort involved to build, but it still takes a commitment to read and learn the required information.  

We assume that you are familiar with open source flight stacks such as ArduPilot or PX4.  We also assume that you know how to use basic tools such as screw drivers, and that you know how to solder.  Or know someone who does.  If you do not have skills with tools or a soldering iron we have provided some resources here, as it's never too late to learn.

Overall, if we do not have the answer we will try to point you in the right direction to go find it.  If you feel like we missed something let us know.  And remember, *search is your friend*.


## Define Basic Requirements

There are many questions that should be answered before you begin your build.    How do you plan to use your robot? Going to fly indoors?  How long does it really need to fly?  Does it need to fly at all?  So start at the end and work backwards to define your requirements.

But before you do, we recommend you skim the docs here to get familar with the devFrame in general, and the structure of the docs specifically.  Have a look at some of the community builds to see some capabilities.  Then come back here and spend some time thinking about what you need to build to meet you goals.  

### Data Requirements

What type of data do you need and how are you going to get it?  Or maybe you are just flying for fun so just need a bit of telemetry to keep an eye on things.  What type and size of sensor(s) do you need to fly to gather your data?

### Performance Requirements

Do you need to fly indoors.
