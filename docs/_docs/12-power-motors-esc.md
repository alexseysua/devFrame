**Caution** -- This section requires soldering.  A bad solder joint can cause complete loss of power so please make sure you are comfortable creating good solder joints before proceeding.
{: .notice--info}

In this section we will install power distribution, motors, and electronic speed controls (ESC's).

## Power Planning

Note -- One of the more challenging aspects of building your own robot is providing clean power to various components with different voltage and current demands.  Make sure you consider all power requirements for your use case.
{: .notice--primary}

There are many different types and brands of equipment that can meet your onboard and flight power needs.  We are using what we had available in the shop, as well as what we feel represents a general 450 class setup.  

### Power Distro

In this guide we will use an ACP4 Power Module, which will also act as our Power Distribution Board (PDB).  The ACP4 includes current and voltage sense, as well as both 5V and 12V voltage regulators (BEC).  We will use the 5V BEC to power the flight controller (PixRacer in this build) and sensors.  We will add an additional Castle Creations 10A BEC set to 5V output to power the optional companion computer (RPi 4 in this build).  Any similar power module and/or PDB will do fine, but we do recommend you have a seperate 5V source for your flight control and companion computer.  

### Motors

We have chosen a T-Motor Air Gear 350 set, which includes four AIR2213 KV920 brushless motors, and four plastic T9545 self-tighhtening props.  Partly because we already had a set, and also because they are a good value.  At the time of this writing the Air Gear 350 can be hard to find.  Some Air Gear sets include the ECS's, but for this build we are using ESC telemetry so went with another brand.  Any motors in the ~900-1000kV range with 8-10in props should work fine for a 450 class build.

### ESC's

For ESC's we are using four Luminier BLHeli32 36A with DShot and ESC telemetry support.  Any ESC with proper power handling will work just fine, but we do highly recommend DShot and ESC telemetry support as it will make tuning much easier.  4-in-1 ESC's are also an option, and do provide a cleaner build in terms of wiring harness.

### Wire and Connectors

For this build we are using 14AWG for the battery connection.  Motors and ESC's are equiped with 16 or 18 AWG from the factory.  See Resources section [for more info on wire and wire gauge (AWG)]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/resources/#wire-gauge)). 

In our shop we use 45A Anderson Powerpoles for connectors on builds 450 or larger.  We prefer the crimp connections.  We use XT series connectors for smaller builds, which is a more popular option in the RC community.  For a 450 build an XT60 will work well.  See the Resources page [for more info on connectors]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/resources/#power-cables-and-connectors).

### Battery

Although we will not need the battery in this section we are planning on using a 4S 4350mAHr lipo.  You could use a 3 or 4 cell setup for a 450.  Again we are using what we had in the shop, so 4S lipo it is.  

Note -- Keep in mind that the recommended max gross weight for the devFrame is 2kg or 4.4 pounds.  Running a larger battery may mean you are payload limited.  Running a larger payload may mean you are battery, and therefore flight time limited.

## Step 1 - Power System Wiring

Note -- The motor mounts are designed to support routing the wires inside the arm tube.  In this build we will route outside the tube.  It is largely a matter of preference.  Routing motor wires outside the arm tube is slightly easier to assemble and maintain, while routing inside the tube presents a cleaner build.
{: .notice--primary}

In this step we will connect wires between motors and ESC's, between ESC's and PDB, connect our battery leads, and add a 5V BEC.  You will need:
- Motors
- ESC's
- PDB
- BEC (and any other equipmet soldered to PDB)
- Ruler
- Wire Cutter
- Wire Strippers
- Soldering Kit
- Heat Shrink Tubing 
- Wire (if not supplied with motors or ESC's)

### 1.1 - Motors to ESC's
- To get accurate measurements, first locate mounting position for the ESC's. We will install our ESC's for this build on the Arm Tube clamps using double-sided tape and zipties.  

- Measure and note distance between motors and ESC's.  Add a few millimeters to allow for overlappig solder joints.

![Measure Motor ESC]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/power-esc-motors/measure-esc-motor.jpeg){: width="60%" .align-center}

- Solder each motor wire to ESC wire.

![Motor ESC Soldered]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/power-esc-motors/solder-motor-esc.jpeg){: width="60%" .align-center}

- Repeat three more times until all motor to ESC wires are soldered.   


### 1.2 - ESC's to PDB
- We will be mounting the PDB under the flight controller in the middle of the bottom set of frame tubes.
- Measure and note distance between ESC's and PDB.  Add a few millimeters to allow for overlappig solder joints.

![Measure ESC PDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/power-esc-motors/measure-esc-pdb.jpeg){: width="60%" .align-center}

- Solder each ESC wire to PDB

![ESC PDB Soldered]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/power-esc-motors/solder-esc-pdb.jpeg){: width="60%" .align-center}


- Repeat three more times until all ESC wires are soldered to PDB

### 1.3 - Battery and BEC Connections
- In step two we will physically install the PDB to the frame, so now is a good time to soldered any other wires needed for your build.  
- We soldered 14AWG silicone wire to our battery connections. We recommend leaving these wires long if you are not sure how your battery will mount.  We plan on mounting our battery to the top level of the frame so know our approximate wire length.
- Now is also a good time to solder on any extra connections to PDB.  We installed a 5V BEC to provide power to equipment such as companion computer and high power demand sensors.

### 1.4 - ESC Telemetry Wires
- We plan on using ESC telemetry for this build, which requires soldering each of the ESC telemetry wires together.
- The telemetry wire bundle needs to be connected to a serial port on the flight controller.  You will need to solder the telemetry wires to a harness/connector supported by your choice of autopilot.
- We will use the ESP module WiFi port on the top of the PixRacer.  As that port accepts 0.1in Dupont pins we will solder our ESC telemetry wires to a header pin.  We actually use two pins, but one is blank to help keep the connection more secure.
