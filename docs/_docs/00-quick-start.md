If you are an expereinced builder or just want a high level overview of how to build a devFrame this is the spot to start.  Skip to the Community Builds section if you are ready to go.  If not, have a read through the docs.

## Basic Build Steps
1. Plan your build:  Select the type, size, and configuration of your devFrame based on your goals.
2. Print your parts:  Print them yourself, or use a service, or barter with a friend who has a printer.
3. Gather the parts and tools:  Make sure you have everything you need.
4. Build the hardware:  Put it all together.
5. Configure the software: We provide some advice, lots of links, and complete parameter files for common builds.
6. Test it:  Make sure it works like it should.  Remember, smart is safe
7. Iterate:  Tweak as required - Luckily, the devFrame is pretty flexible and easy to tweak
8. Contribute:  Enjoying your devFrame?  Cool!  Let us know and share your expereince with the community.  It's good karma.
