## The devFrame Is For...

Short answer:  Anyone who wants to build a small quadcopter or rover.

Long answer:  Anyone building a small robot who needs or wants the flexibility of building from open source ecosystems while reducing barriers to entry and increasing sustainability.

If you are an experienced builder, or just want a high level overview of how to build a devFrame, this is the spot to start.  Skip to the Community Builds section if you are ready to go.  If not, have a full read through the docs.

### Some Assumptions
While we try to provide enough information to help you achieve your devFrame building goals we do make some assumptions about skill and motivation levels.  Building a robot from a kit is time consuming.  The biggest goal for the devFrame project is to reduce the amount of time and effort involved to build, but it still takes a commitment to read and learn the required information.  

We assume that you can either print the frame parts or have access to someone who can.   More information on 3D printing the frame parts can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/printing/).

We assume that you are familiar with open source flight stacks such as ArduPilot or PX4.  We also assume that you know how to use [basic tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tools/) such as screw drivers, and that you know how to solder.  Or know someone who does.  If you do not have skills with tools or a soldering iron we have provided some resources [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/resources/), as it's never too late to learn.

Overall, if we do not have the answer we will try to point you in the right direction to go find it.  If you feel like we missed something [let us know]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/).  And remember, *search is your friend*.

## Basic Build Steps
1. Plan your build:  Select the type, size, and configuration of your devFrame based on your requirements.
2. Print your parts:  Print them yourself, or use a service, or barter with a friend who has a printer.
3. Gather the parts and tools:  Make sure you have everything you need.
4. Build the hardware:  Put it all together.  We provide lots of pictures.
5. Configure the software: We provide some advice, lots of links, and complete parameter files for common builds.
6. Test it:  Make sure it works like it should.  Remember, smart is safe.
7. Iterate:  Tweak as required.  Luckily, the devFrame is pretty flexible and easy to tweak.
8. Contribute:  Enjoying your devFrame?  Cool!  Let us know and share your experience with the community.  It's good karma.
