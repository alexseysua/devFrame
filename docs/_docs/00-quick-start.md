## The devFrame Is For...

Short answer:  Anyone who wants to build a small quadcopter or rover.

Long answer:  Anyone building a small robot who needs or wants the flexibility of building from open source ecosystems while reducing barriers to entry while increasing sustainability.

If you are an experienced builder, or just want a high level overview of how to build a devFrame, this is the spot to start.  Skip to the Community Builds section if you are ready to go.  If not, have a full read through the docs.

## Basic Build Steps
1. Plan your build:  Select the type, size, and configuration of your devFrame based on your requirements.
2. Print your parts:  Print them yourself, or use a service, or barter with a friend who has a printer.
3. Gather the parts and tools:  Make sure you have everything you need.
4. Build the hardware:  Put it all together.  We provide lots of pictures.
5. Configure the software: We provide some advice, lots of links, and complete parameter files for common builds.
6. Test it:  Make sure it works like it should.  Remember, smart is safe.
7. Iterate:  Tweak as required.  Luckily, the devFrame is pretty flexible and easy to tweak.
8. Contribute:  Enjoying your devFrame?  Cool!  Let us know and share your experience with the community.  It's good karma.
