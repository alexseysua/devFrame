## Searching
Knowing how to use search is an important part of being a good internet citizen and community member.  For example, it is considered to be bad form to ask questions in a support forum that have already been asked, and likely answered.  

## Soldering
Owning or having access to quality soldering tools is a must for building your own robot.  Knowing how to use them correctly is just as important as owning them. [Here's a really good tutorial](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/).  And plenty of videos on the web.  Do not underestimate the importance of helping hands and/or jigs to hold things in place while you solder.

## Crimping
Crimping pins is not a requirement, but can be a very handy skill to have.  Perhaps the most ubiquitous crimp pin is the Dupont style servo pin.  Here is a fascinating and deatisl guide to [getting your crimps right](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Good-Dupont-Pin-Crimp-EVERY-TIME/).

## Other Frames 

We realize the devFrame is not your only option.  You could already own a frame or want to support another project.  All good with us.  While we have no plans to add details about other frames or projects, you should still be able to use our docs to help build and configure where there is common ground between projects.

[TBS Source One] https://github.com/tbs-trappy/source_one Is an all carbon fiber FPV style frame that suupports up to seven inch props.

[OpenRC Truggy] https://github.com/bryancostanich/OpenRC/tree/master/Truggy Is a Creative Commons licensed project that has an enthusiastic following.  Perhaps more support for the F1 variant, but the Truggy is likely a better fit for building a rover.  However, if you are not into RC cars this might be a bit advanced.
