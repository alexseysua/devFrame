## Searching
Knowing how to use search is an important part of being a good internet citizen and community member.  For example, it is considered to be bad form to ask a question in a support forum that has already been asked, and likely answered.  It is expected that you have done some searching to find your own answers prior to asking.

## Soldering
Owning or having access to quality soldering tools is a must for building your own robot.  Knowing how to use them correctly is just as important as owning them. [Here's a really good tutorial](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/).  And plenty of videos on the web.  Do not underestimate the importance of helping hands and/or jigs to hold things in place while you solder.

## Crimping
Crimping pins is not a requirement, but can be a very handy skill to have.  Perhaps the most ubiquitous crimp pin is the Dupont style servo pin.  Here is a fascinating and detailed guide to [getting your crimps right](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Good-Dupont-Pin-Crimp-EVERY-TIME/).

## Other Frames 

We realize the devFrame is not your only option.  You could already own a frame or want to support another project.  All good with us.  While we have no plans to add details about other frames or projects, you should still be able to use our docs to help build and configure where there is common ground between projects.

[TBS Source One](https://github.com/tbs-trappy/source_one) Is an all carbon fiber FPV style frame that supports up to seven inch props with optional long arms.

[OpenRC Truggy](https://github.com/bryancostanich/OpenRC/tree/master/Truggy) Is a Creative Commons licensed project that has an enthusiastic following.  Perhaps more support for the F1 variant, but the Truggy is likely a better fit for building a rover.  However, if you are not into RC cars this might be a bit advanced.

Any of the FlameWheel F450 clones.  Perhaps one of the cheapest 450 class frames out there.  Available on Amazon and other big market sites.  Just make sure to buy spare parts.  Or two sets of the frame for backup.

## Where To Buy
We understand that many builders will be on a tight budget.  However, it is very easy to confuse value with price.  They are not the same.  Forums are filled with stories of cheap clones not working like they should.  Do your homework and spend wisely.

Here is a list of vendors to browse.  It does not inlude Amazon or Banggood or other large market sites.  We order from them, but it is beyond the scope of these docs to keep track of who is selling what via their markets on any given day. We are not affiliated with any of these vendors.  This is simply a list of vendors we have purchased from in the past, and think they offer fair value with consistent support.  If you do not see your favorite vendor on the list let us know and we can see about adding them.
