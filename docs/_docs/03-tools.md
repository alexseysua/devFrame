Caution -- Glue is sticky, knives are sharp, and soldering irons are hot!  Seriously.  Wear safety glasses and pay attention to what you are doing with the business end of any tool.

## The Basics
All you really need is a ruler, hacksaw blade, and Phillips screwdriver to build the base frame.

Note -- There is a difference in sizes and quality of [Phillips screwdrivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips).  If you find yourself stripping heads check that you have the right size and a well machined tool.

## Solder and Crimp
In order to build your power distribution you will very likely have to solder.  And if you are using servo style pins, a crimping tool and crimp pins are very handy to have in order to build custom cables.  Don't forget we have a few links over in [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/resources/#soldering) if you aren't sure how to use this stuff.

### Example Kit
Similar to what is pictured:
- [Soldering Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Upgraded-Adjustable-Temperature-Screwdrivers/)
- [Soldering Station](https://www.amazon.com/KinCam-Soldering-Anti-Static-Temperature-Adjustable/dp/B07Y47Y934/)
- [Heat Shrink Tubing](https://www.amazon.com/560PCS-Heat-Shrink-Tubing-Eventronic/dp/B072PCQ2LW/)
- [2.54mm/0.1in Crimps, Pins and Housings](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DZB8NDW/)

Soldering jigs are pretty easy to build to save a few quid.  Take a close look at the picture above and you will see a block of wood with clothes pins glued on.  Works well to get started.  If you have it in the budget then buy something fancy.  It's worth it.

## Other Tools
While you do not need everything on the list, it will be a good idea to start adding them to your collection as soon as possible.  Remember, tools are an investment.
- Multimeter -- Mainly one that can do continuity check and measure DC voltage.
- Scissors -- Usually for cutting velcro strips.
- Hobby Knife -- Handy for trimming plastic and cutting sticky tape.
- Pliers -- Needle-nose are usually best for reaching hard to get wires and fasteners.
- Allen Wrenches -- Usually needed if you are going to work around this type of equipment
- Adjustable Wrench -- Might be needed to tighten your props or small nuts.
- Calipers -- There's always something that is easier to measure with calipers.
