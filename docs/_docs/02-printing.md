All devFrame parts have been designed to print on a small desktop printer capable of printing in ABS.  No support material, raft or brim is required to print any of the parts.  We test print all parts on a Lulzbot Mini.

For a full list of printed parts, with links to download stl files, please see the [Frame Details]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/frame-details/#3d-printed-parts) page.

## Material Selection
ABS, ABS or ABS.  At least you can pick a color.  We have found nothing that compares to ABS in strength, toughness, durability, service temp, **and** price.  If you would like to experiment with materials, please let us know how it turns out.

Note -- Some print services do not offer ABS as an option.  PETG or other coploymers with properties similar to ABS **might** work, but they have not been tested as of this writing.

There are some optional parts, such as Landing Gear Feet, that are designed to be flexible, and should be printed in TPE/TPU.  Just look for TPU at the end of the file name.

## Print Settings
There are only two different profiles we use for devFrame parts:
 - Solid -- 0.3mm layer height, 2 perimeters, 100% infill
 - Standard -- 0.3mm layer height, 2 perimeters, 50% infill

In general, if it's a small part such as a sensor mount, or it is going to see a lot of stress like a motor mount, we will use Solid.  Otherwise, everything is printed using the Standard profile.

Note -- The [Frame Details]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/frame-details/#frame) section of the docs lists each part and respective print setting.
